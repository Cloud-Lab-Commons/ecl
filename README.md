## Overview
This repository contains experimentally validated cloud protocols on the Emerald Cloud Laboratory platform. We hope this resource will become an ever-expanding library of open-source protocols for life science research.

## Adding code to the Cloud Lab library:

We encourage users to adopt an “early and often” approach when committing code. It is advisable to make frequent commits, especially during the development phase to help other users that may be struggling with the same bug.

We suggest utilizing the sandbox folder for code that doesn’t quite work, and the pages, scripts, & functions folder for debugged code.

Steps to add code:
1. **Clone the Repository:** Go to the GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/Cloud-Lab-Commons/ecl
2. **Start with coding with templates:** The page, script and function templates are designed to ensure good coding practices such as explaining functionality and deleting old samples.
3. **Export your files:** Modify the code on your local machine using Emerald Cloud Lab command center.
4. **Stage Changes:** Move the .m file you want to commit to the appropriate folder and type “git add <your .m file>”.
5. **Commit Changes:** Create a snapshot of your changes with a description using the “git commit -m <information about your change>” command.
6. **Push Changes:** Upload your committed changes back to the GitHub repository with “git push.”

That’s it! You’ve successfully checked in your code!
